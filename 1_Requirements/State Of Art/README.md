     1. Inability of modification of data: The managing of huge data
        effectively and efficiently for efficient results, storing the details of the
        consumers etc. 
     2. Not user friendly: The existing system is not user friendly because
        the retrieval and storing of data is slow and data is not maintained
        efficiently.
     3. Difficulty in reports generating: Either no reports generating in a
        current system or they are generated with great difficulty reports take
        time to generate in the current system.
     4. Manual operator control: Manual operator control is there and lead
        to a lot of chaos and errors.
     5. Lot of paperwork: Existing system requires lot of paper work and
        even a small transaction require many papers fill. 
     6. Inability of sharing the data: Data cannot be shared in the existing
        system. 
     7. No support in decision-making: Existing system does not support
        managerial decision-making.
     8. No support in strategic competitive advantage: Existing system do
        not support strategic competitive advantages.

     1. Easiness in modification of data: The proposed system provides
